# hello-world
This is my greetings to the GitHub community.

Hello fellow GitHubians!

I am learning Python, have some knowledge of C# and know a bit about HTML and CSS.  
I hope to create and save projects here that will change the World.
Thank you for creating this really cool resource, and I hope to show my 
appreciation by creating stuff that people will find useful.

Cheers and don't forget the moon tacos.
